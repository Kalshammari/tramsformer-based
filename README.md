**Multivariate Time Series-based Solar Flare Prediction by Transformer and Attention-based Model**
The code is an implementation of the Transformer and Attention-based Model for Multivariate Time Series-based Solar Flare Classification. It is implemented using PyTorch.
**Overview**

This repository provides the implementation of the Transformer-based MVTS Classification Framework. The repository has:

    data/ contains the required dataset files.
    Models/ contains the implementation of the LSTM-based MVTS Feature Selection Framework and baseline methods implementation.
    requirements.txt contains the libraries and tools needed to execute the models.

    
  **Dependencies**
  
The models have been tested running under Python 3.9.7, with the required packages installed (see the requirements.txt for package details along with their dependencies). In addition, CUDA 11.1 in a Windows server has been used.
